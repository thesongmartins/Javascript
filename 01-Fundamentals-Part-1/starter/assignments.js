1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, then how many people would live in each half?

4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does you country have less people than the average country?

1. If your country's population is greater than 33 million, log a string like this to the console: 'Portugal's population is above average'. Otherwise, log a string like 'Portugal's population is 22 million below average' (the 22 is the average of 33 minus the country's population).

2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to 130. See the different results, and set the population back to original.
