3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case numNeighbours is greater than 1
4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when numNeighbours is 0 or any other value)
5. Test the code with different values of numNeighbours, including 1 and 0.
6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of numNeighbours. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why is this happening?
7. Finally, convert numNeighbours to a number, and watch what happens now when you input 1
8. Reflect on why we should use the === in this situation.

2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a country that speaks english, has less than 50 million people and is not an island.
3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her. You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.
4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('
5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in a small country :D)
