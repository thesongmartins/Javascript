// Functions Declarations and Expressions
/*
1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration called percentageOfWorld1 which receives a population value, and returns the percentage of the world population that the given population represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of the world population.

2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given population value by 7900 and then multiply by 100.

3. Call percentageOfWorld1 for 3 populations of countries of your choice, store the results into variables, and log them to the console.

4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called percentageOfWolrd2, and also call it with 3 country populations (can be the same populations).

 3. Call describePopulation with data for 3 countries of your choice.

// Basic Array operations
/*
Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array into a variable called neighbours.

At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of your selected country, so add it to the end of the neighbours array.

Unfortunately, after some time the new country is dissolved, so remove it from the end of the array.

If the neighbours array does not include the country 'Germany', log to the console: 'Probably not a central european country :D'.

Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the index of the country in the neighbours array, and then use that index to change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for 'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.
