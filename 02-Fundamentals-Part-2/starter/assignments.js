// Functions Declarations and Expressions
/*
1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration called percentageOfWorld1 which receives a population value, and returns the percentage of the world population that the given population represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of the world population.

2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given population value by 7900 and then multiply by 100.

3. Call percentageOfWorld1 for 3 populations of countries of your choice, store the results into variables, and log them to the console.

4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called percentageOfWolrd2, and also call it with 3 country populations (can be the same populations).

 1. Create a function called describePopulation. Use the function type you like the most. This function takes in two arguments: country and population, and returns a strings like this: 'China has 1441 million people, which is about 18.2% of the world'.

 2. To calculate the percentage, describePopulation calls the percentageOfWorld1 you created earlier.

 3. Call describePopulation with data for 3 countries of your choice.
